# Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis & Machine Learning

## Objective
To perform exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and build a basic machine learning model to predict passenger survival.

## Dataset
Titanic Dataset (Binary Classification)

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   Titanic_EDA_ML.ipynb
4. Run all cells

## Machine Learning Model
- Logistic Regression

## Results
- Achieved ~80% accuracy
- Gender and passenger class were strong predictors
