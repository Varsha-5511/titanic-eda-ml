# Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis & Machine Learning

## Objective
To perform exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and build a basic machine learning model to predict passenger survival.

## Dataset
Titanic Dataset (Binary Classification)

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Brief Explanation of the Approach
The project starts with loading and exploring the Titanic dataset to understand its structure and identify missing values. Basic data cleaning techniques such as handling missing data and encoding categorical variables were applied to make the dataset suitable for machine learning. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed using visualizations to identify important patterns and relationships between features and survival. Finally, the data was split into training and testing sets, and a Logistic Regression model was trained and evaluated to predict passenger survival.

## Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
`Titanic_EDA_ML.ipynb`
4. Run all cells

## Machine Learning Model
- Logistic Regression

## Results
- Achieved ~80% accuracy
- Gender and passenger class were strong predictors
